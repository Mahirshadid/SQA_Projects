Framework: Mocha  
Automation Tool: WebdriverIO  
Reporting: Allure  
Bug Tracking: Jira  

🚀 Project Overview  
The goal of this project was to automate functional testing for PHPTravels using Mocha and WebdriverIO. Since the site is a live production environment, the tests were limited.

⚡ Key Challenges  
The most interesting challenge encountered during this project was handling iFrame elements. Navigating and interacting with elements inside an iFrame required special handling, and WebdriverIO’s capabilities were leveraged to implement solutions that ensure consistent and reliable test results.

📊 Key Features  
Automated functional tests for a live website using Mocha and WebdriverIO.  
Managed testing flow with Allure for detailed test reporting.  
Tracked bugs and tasks using Jira for better project management.  

🔍 Lessons Learned  
Working with live production environments requires extra caution to avoid impacting real users.  
Handling iFrames is a critical skill in web automation, especially for dynamic content.  
Integration of Allure and Jira enhances test reporting and project tracking.
